TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

Calculating F1 Score...

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

Altered model has 8 nodes and 0 flows.

Precision: 1.0, Recall: 0.5, F1 Score: 0.6666666666666666

Precision: The proportion of correctly matched nodes and flows (TP) out of all predicted matches (TP + FP).
Recall: The proportion of correctly matched nodes and flows (TP) out of all actual matches (TP + FN).
