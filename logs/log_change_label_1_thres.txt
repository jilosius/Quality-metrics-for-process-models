FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Calculating F1 Score...

TP (True Positives): The number of nodes in the reference model that were successfully matched with a node in the altered model based on the similarity criteria.
FP (False Positives): The number of nodes in the altered model that were incorrectly matched with a node in the reference model when they should not have been matched.
FN (False Negatives): The number of nodes in the reference model that did not have a match in the altered model, even though a match should exist.

Reference model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.

Altered model has 8 nodes and 8 flows.
